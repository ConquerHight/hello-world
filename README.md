# hello-world
just another repository
hi, I vincent

This is me learning git and github
Also new to programing(well,... relatively new) I am also learning alot about the linux os and the command line, I know thats alot at one go, wait for this.....

I am also in the process of preparing for my 1st semester exams as a freshman, like its literally less than four week away.

I hope i come back to this code after all this and be glad I succeeded in them all :)
